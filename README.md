# ISS Locator

### To run program:
- I used poetry so there is a pyproject.toml file that has all necessary dependencies
- poetry init
- poetry install
- poetry shell
- python iss.py

### To change the third output, of when the ISS will be over a certain state:
- there is an OBJ at the top of the program (iss.py)
- change the value for key 'lat' to the latitude of position
- change the value for key 'lon' to the longitude of position
